# Pixelator

Create some pixel art.

## TODO

- Bug when downsizing grid.
    Causes colors to change to default orange on last grid rows and columns.
    Refreshing the page after downsizing, causes these pixels to disappear.

- Bug when pressing the grid reset button.
    It basically causes a full page refresh when pressing it. Why?

## Ideas

- Color history of brush
- Photo capture of current grid
